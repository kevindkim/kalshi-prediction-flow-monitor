# Kalshi Prediction Flow Monitor

A TypeScript CLI-based flow tracker using Kalshi that authenticates with API keys, streams live public trades via WebSockets, and filters for "big trades" ($5k+ notional trades) with helpful market details. Trades are anonymous, but gives a sense of where the big money is going.

Future iterations will include market-level swings and a web interface, as well as notifications.

## How It Works
- `generateKalshiAuthHeaders` signs requests with RSA-PSS so we can log in over REST and open an authenticated WebSocket (`src/kalshi-signer.ts`, `src/kalshi-auth.ts`).
- `KalshiClient` subscribes to the `trade` channel and emits each trade as an event (`src/kalshi-client.ts`).
- `TradeFilter` tracks notional in USD using the side-specific dollar price and share count, emits `bigTrade` events when the value meets the $5,000 bar (`src/trade-filter.ts`).
â€“ `getMarketDetails` fetches titles, rules, and expirations for the ticker so alerts include plain-language context (`src/kalshi-market-lookup.ts`).

```
WebSocket â†’ KalshiClient â†’ TradeFilter (â‰¥ $5k) â†’ Market Lookup â†’ Alert
```

Sample alert:
```
ðŸ’° BIG TRADE: $8,456.00
Oklahoma City vs Indiana Winner?
Rules: If Oklahoma City wins, YES resolves.

Ticker: KXNBAGAME-25OCT23OKCIND-OKC
Side: yes | Price: 68Â¢ | Size: 12,435 contracts
```

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Kalshi API key pair (API Key ID + RSA private key in PEM format), just need a regular account to create

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials (never commit secrets):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Store the PEM file referenced above (default path is `./kalshi-private-key.pem`). Only keep it locally.

## Running the Stream
```bash
npm run start
```
You should see the authentication, subscription confirmation, and any trade alerts above the $5k cutoff.

## Next Steps
- Add automated tests around notional calculation and signer logic before productionising.
- Instrument reconnection logic and structured logging if you plan to run the monitor continuously.
